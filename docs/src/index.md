# CopyNumberPainter.jl

Paints somatic copy-number alterations onto cell-lineage trees — ground truth for
copy-number phylogenetics.

Give it a tree — simulated by
[`NonMarkovEvolution.jl`](https://github.com/alexsteininfo/NonMarkovEvolution.jl)
or read from a newick file — and it draws copy-number alterations along the edges from
a diploid or given root state, returning the allele-specific profile of **every** node
together with a **complete log** of the events that produced it. Profiles then project
onto a fixed bin grid, which is the form real low-coverage single-cell DNA data arrives
in and the form every inference method consumes.

This package is an **observation model**. It does not infer trees, estimate parameters,
or compute distances between profiles.

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/alexsteininfo/CopyNumberPainter.jl")
```

Dependencies are deliberately minimal — `Random`, `Distributions`, `StatsBase`, `CodecZlib` and `TOML` — so
that depending on this package for its types stays cheap.
`NonMarkovEvolution.jl` is a *weak* dependency: load it alongside and the tree
converter appears; leave it out and nothing is missing but the converter.

## Quickstart

```julia
using CopyNumberPainter

assembly = hg38(:female)

# A small lineage tree: root -> two divisions -> four leaves. Real trees come from
# NonMarkovEvolution.jl or a newick file:
#   tree = read_newick("lineage.nwk"; branchlength = :divisions)
tree = phylotree([nothing, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3];
                 edge_divisions = [nothing, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

model = CNAModel(
    rate      = PerDivision(0.5),                              # Poisson(λ · divisions)
    target    = CNWeighted(1.0),                               # gains beget gains
    extent    = ExtentMixture(p_chromosome = 0.05, p_arm = 0.15),
    kind      = GainLoss(0.6),                                 # 60% gains
    wgd       = ScheduledWGD(mrca(tree, [4, 5]) => 1),         # one doubling, exactly there
    viability = RejectAndRedraw(min_total_cn = 1),
    initial   = TruncalCNAs(4),                                # four clonal alterations
)

res = simulate_cnas(tree, assembly, model; seed = 20260904)

# Every node's profile, and every event
profile(res, treeroot(tree))          # the truncal state
leaf_profiles(res)                    # the observable cells
res.events                            # the complete record
res.rejections                        # how often viability bit

# Project and export
grid = BinGrid(assembly, 500_000)
mat  = CNMatrix(res, grid)
write_medicc2("cells.tsv", mat)       # input for the reference method
write_profiles("truth.tsv", res)      # the ground truth to compare against
write_events("events.tsv", res)
```
