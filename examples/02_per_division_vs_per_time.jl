# Example 2: per-division vs per-time rates — the question the package exists to ask.
#
# Whether copy-number alterations accrue per cell division or per unit of real time is
# the Markov-versus-non-Markov question transposed from point mutations. Under
# exponential division timing the two are hard to tell apart; under non-exponential
# timing they are not, because division count and elapsed time decouple. See
# docs/src/model.md, "Rate: the question the package exists to ask".
#
# Run with: julia --project examples/02_per_division_vs_per_time.jl

# Two lineages from one root, deliberately decoupling divisions from elapsed time:
#   node 2 ("fast"): 10 divisions in 1 unit of real time  — a rapidly cycling clone.
#   node 3 ("slow"):  1 division  in 10 units of real time — a dormant clone.
# A newick file or a NonMarkovEvolution.jl tree would carry both quantities the same
# way; here they are set explicitly to make the contrast obvious.
