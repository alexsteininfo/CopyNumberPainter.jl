"""
    ViabilityRule

Which proposed alterations are allowed to happen.

An alteration can drive a region, a whole chromosome, or the single X of a male
karyotype to copy number 0. Real data contains no cells with whole-chromosome
nullisomy, so an unconstrained process generates profiles that could not exist.
Rejected proposals are **redrawn**, not skipped and not fatal to the cell: the tree is
an *input* with its own birth–death history, so killing a cell here would contradict
the given tree and silently change the sampled population size.

!!! warning "This conditions the model"
    Rejection sampling makes the alteration process *conditional on viability*, so the
    realised distribution of alterations is not the proposal distribution. That is a
    modelling assumption, and any analysis built on these simulations has to state it.
    The rejection tally is returned in [`CNAEvolution`](@ref) so the size of the effect
    is visible rather than hidden.

Distinct from viability, and never switchable off: copy number 0 is **absorbing**,
because absent DNA cannot be regained (see [`apply!`](@ref)). Viability is about
states that are *unobserved*; absorption is about states that are *impossible*.
A proposal that falls entirely on absent DNA would change nothing; it is redrawn,
tallied as `:no_effect`, and does not count against `max_attempts`.

The whole interface is one method — `violation(rule, profile, event)` returning a
reason symbol or `nothing` — so a new class of impossible state is a new struct and no
change to the traversal.

Concrete rules: [`AllowAll`](@ref), [`RejectAndRedraw`](@ref), [`AllRules`](@ref).
"""
abstract type ViabilityRule end

"""
    AllowAll()

Impose no viability constraint. Alterations may drive whole chromosomes to copy number
0, so the output can contain cells that could not exist — filter downstream, or use
[`RejectAndRedraw`](@ref).
"""
struct AllowAll <: ViabilityRule end

"""
    RejectAndRedraw(; min_total_cn = 1, max_attempts = 100)

Reject and redraw any alteration that would push a chromosome's **total** copy number
— summed over its haplotypes — below `min_total_cn` at any position it touches.

With the default `min_total_cn = 1`, no position of any chromosome may lose all its
copies.

!!! note "The default forbids all homozygous deletions"
    `min_total_cn = 1` forbids homozygous deletions **of any size**, not merely
    whole-chromosome nullisomy — which was the concern that motivated the rule. Real
    tumours do contain small homozygous deletions, so set `min_total_cn = 0`, or use
    [`AllowAll`](@ref), if focal biallelic loss should be permitted. This is recorded
    as an open question in the manual.

Exceeding `max_attempts` throws rather than silently skipping the alteration, because
a silent skip would bias the realised rate with no signal that it happened.
