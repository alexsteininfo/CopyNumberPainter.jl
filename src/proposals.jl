    TargetDraw

Which chromosome and haplotype a copy-number alteration lands on.

A rule is a callable `(profile, rng) -> (chrom, haplotype)`; implement a new one by
adding a method to [`draw_target`](@ref), or just pass a plain function.

Chromosomes with zero ploidy — `chrY` in a female assembly — are never eligible.
Haplotype choice is uniform over a chromosome's slots unless the rule says otherwise,
which is what lets mirrored allelic imbalance arise on its own rather than being
injected.

Concrete rules: [`UniformChromosome`](@ref), [`LengthWeighted`](@ref),
[`CNWeighted`](@ref).

"""
    CNWeighted(β = 1.0; length_weighted = true)

Haplotype slot chosen with weight proportional to its copy-number **material**:
chromosome length × mean copy number^`β`. With the defaults that is the number of
base-pair copies the slot carries, so every copy of every base pair is equally likely
to be hit and already-gained material keeps being gained. This is the rule that
conditions the proposal on the mother cell's copy-number state, and it is what
produces realistic ploidy skew.

`length_weighted = false` drops the length factor, giving weight `mean_cn^β` per
slot: chromosomes are then equally likely at equal copy number, whatever their size.

A slot whose mean copy number is 0 gets weight 0 for every `β`, including `β = 0`, so
fully deleted material is never targeted — consistent with copy number 0 being
absorbing. Drawing from a profile in which every slot is empty throws rather than
looping.

Mix whole-chromosome, whole-arm and focal events.

Whole-arm and whole-chromosome events dominate real karyotypes and cannot be produced
at a realistic rate by any continuous length distribution, so they get their own
probabilities. `p_focal` is whatever the two leave over. Setting both to zero ignores
large-scale events entirely without changing the code path.

Focal events draw a length from `lengthdist`, then a start uniform over every position
from which the event still overlaps the chromosome, then **truncate** at whichever end
it overhangs. Truncation rather than rejection, matching MEDICC2. Every position is then
equally likely to be covered, and realised focal lengths are shorter than drawn near
both telomeres. Arm events pick the p or q arm with equal
probability and need the assembly's centromere positions.

The default `lengthdist` spans 100 kb to 100 Mb log-uniformly, so focal and near-arm
sizes are represented across the range real callers report.
