    Segment(start, stop, cn)

A run of constant copy number on one haplotype of one chromosome.

Coordinates are **1-based inclusive**, so `Segment(1, 10, 2)` covers ten base pairs.
`cn` is the number of copies of *this haplotype* over the interval, so a normal
diploid autosome is two slots each holding a single `Segment(1, L, 1)` — which is
exactly MEDICC2's `cn_a`/`cn_b` convention.

    CNProfile(assembly, segments)

One cell's allele-specific copy-number state.

`segments[s]` is the segmentation of haplotype slot `s` (see [`GenomeAssembly`](@ref)):
a sorted, gapless, non-overlapping list of [`Segment`](@ref)s tiling
`1:chromlength(assembly, slot_chrom(assembly, s))`, with no two adjacent segments
sharing a copy number. That canonical form makes `==` meaningful — two profiles are
equal exactly when their segmentations are.

Storage is indexed by slot rather than keyed by `(chromosome, haplotype)` because
`Dict` iteration order is unspecified, and any RNG-consuming pass over haplotypes
would then be irreproducible.

Total copy number is a derived view, never a second representation — see
[`total_cn`](@ref).

Build a normal starting state with [`diploid`](@ref); validate one with
[`check_invariants`](@ref).

    diploid(assembly) -> CNProfile

The normal starting karyotype for `assembly`: every haplotype slot is a single
segment at copy number 1, spanning its whole chromosome.

Sex mode is already baked into the assembly's slot layout, so a male assembly yields
one `chrX` and one `chrY` slot and a female assembly yields two `chrX` slots and no
`chrY` slot.
