    CNARate

How many copy-number alterations fall on one edge of the tree.

Whether CNAs accrue **per division** or **per unit real time** is the
Markov-versus-non-Markov question transposed from point mutations to copy number.
Under exponential division timing the two are hard to tell apart; under
non-exponential timing they are not, because division count and elapsed time
decouple. The input tree carries both, so both are computable — and the difference
between them is the signal, not a nuisance. Supporting both is the point of this
package.

Implement a new rule by adding a method to
`n_cnas(rule, tree, node, rng) -> Int`.

Concrete rules: [`PerDivision`](@ref), [`PerTime`](@ref),
[`FromEdgeMutations`](@ref), [`CustomRate`](@ref).

"""
    PerDivision(λ)

`Poisson(λ · edge_divisions)` alterations on each edge. **The default rate rule.**

Requires `edge_divisions`, i.e. a tree converted from `NonMarkovEvolution.jl` or
read with `branchlength = :divisions`. On a simulated lineage tree every
edge is exactly one division, so this reduces to `Poisson(λ)` — but a newick edge can
represent many divisions, which is why the rate multiplies rather than being applied
per edge.

"""
    PerTime(μ)

`Poisson(μ · Δt)` alterations on each edge, where `Δt` is the edge's elapsed real
time. Requires birthtimes, i.e. a tree from `NonMarkovEvolution.jl` or read with
`branchlength = :time`.

"""
    FromEdgeMutations(p = 1.0)

Take the edge's mutation count as the alteration count.

With the default `p = 1.0` this is **exact identity**: one recorded mutation becomes
one CNA, with no extra randomness. With `p < 1` each mutation independently becomes a
CNA, giving `Binomial(edge_mutations, p)` — which keeps an upstream
fitness-coupled mutation process intact while lowering the realised CNA rate.

Requires `edge_mutations`, i.e. a tree from `NonMarkovEvolution.jl` or read with
`branchlength = :mutations`.
