    CNAEvent

Abstract supertype of copy-number-altering events. Concrete subtypes are
[`SegmentalCNA`](@ref) and [`WholeGenomeDoubling`](@ref).

All state changes go through the single method `apply!(profile, event)`. Keeping the
interface this narrow is what allows a karyotype backend to be added later without
touching tree traversal or the output layer.

    SegmentalCNA(chrom, haplotype, start, stop, delta, scale)

A gain or loss of `delta` copies over `start:stop` on one haplotype of one chromosome.

Coordinates are 1-based inclusive. `delta` is positive for a gain and negative for a
loss; a loss that drives the copy number to 0 *is* loss of heterozygosity and needs no
separate event type. `scale` records which class of draw produced the event —
`:focal`, `:arm` or `:chromosome` — so events can be tallied by class afterwards; it
carries no semantics of its own, since an arm-level and a focal event differ only in
their extent.

    WholeGenomeDoubling(mode = :multiply)

A doubling of the entire genome, crossing chromosome boundaries.

`mode` decides the arithmetic and matters as soon as any segment is already at copy
number 2 or more:

- `:multiply` — every copy number is doubled (`cn → 2cn`). This is what
  tetraploidization means, and it preserves zeros for free. **The default.**
- `:increment` — every *non-zero* copy number gains one (`cn → cn + 1`). This is
  MEDICC2's own definition of a WGD event, provided so that profiles can be generated
  on MEDICC2's terms.

The two coincide while all copy numbers are 0 or 1.
