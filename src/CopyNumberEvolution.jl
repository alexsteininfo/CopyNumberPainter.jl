    CopyNumberEvolution

Forward simulation of somatic copy-number alterations along a cell-lineage tree.

Takes a lineage tree — simulated by `NonMarkovEvolution.jl` or read from a newick
file — and draws copy-number alterations along its edges from a diploid or given root
state, returning the allele-specific copy-number profile of every node together with a
complete log of the events that produced it. Profiles project onto a fixed bin grid,
the form real low-coverage single-cell DNA data arrives in.

This package is an *observation model*. It does not infer trees, estimate parameters,
or compute distances between profiles.

See the manual for the modelling choices and their consequences, and
`literature/MEDICC2.md` for the reference method this model is calibrated against.
